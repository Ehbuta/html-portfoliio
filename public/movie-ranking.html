<h3>The Accountant (2016)</h3>
<p>Released in 2016, this movie helped establish the character of Christian Wolff and his unique style and personality traits</p>
<h3>Widows (2018)</h3>
<p>Widows is another of Bernthal's works. The movie is directed by acclaimed Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen, though it is one of the more underrated works in his career as well. Though it has significant crime, thriller, and heist aspects, it really leans in on its intense drama, making it an extremely compelling film. The film did extremely well with critics, getting a 91% Rotten Tomatoes score.</p>
<h3>Triple Frontier (2019)</h3>
<p>Triple Frontier, focuses on a group of special operatives and friends who attempt to rob money from a South American drug lord. Like The Accountant 2, it contains conspiracy elements and sees its characters get far too deep into the situations they are in.</p>
